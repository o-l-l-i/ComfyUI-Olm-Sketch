## ✨ What Is This?

**Olm Sketch** is a lightweight and responsive drawing node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). It lets you sketch or scribble directly inside the node graph - perfect for fast iterations, ControlNet workflows, or simple markups.

No need to jump to a painting app - you can draw, adjust, and export images without leaving ComfyUI or evaluating the graph.

Use it for:

- Quick sketching inside i2i workflows
- ControlNet scribble guides
- Painting base ideas without launching external tools
- Immediate visual feedback and iteration

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone this repository into your `custom_nodes` folder.**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/o-l-l-i/ComfyUI-Olm-Sketch.git
    ```

    Your folder should look like:

    ```
    ComfyUI/
    └── custom_nodes/
        └── ComfyUI-Olm-Sketch/
            ├── __init__.py
            ├── olm_sketch.py
            └── ...
    ```

2. **Restart ComfyUI** to load the new node.

There are no extra dependencies - it works out of the box.

---

## 🧪 Basic Usage

1. Add the **Olm Sketch** node from the node search menu.
2. Start drawing directly on the canvas in the node.
3. Use tool buttons and UI fields for crop, flip, rotate, etc.
4. To save your sketch, click the save button in the node.
    - Files are saved to `ComfyUI/output/my_drawings/` by default.
    - You can change the output subfolder and filename directly in the node UI.
    - Alternatively you can of course render it out and use Save Image node.
5. Automatic saving happens when saving scenes/graphs and files go to `ComfyUI/output/olm_sketch_cache/`.
6. Upload an image via the built-in UI to draw on an existing base.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- No built-in undo/redo support yet.
- 2048x2048 resolution limit (4K support planned.)
- No layer support - this is a lightweight sketch node, not a full painting suite.
- Very basic mask support - you can output an image as a mask (no overlay support or such yet.)
- Saved images are overwritten if using the same name (watch your filenames!)
- While I put effort to automatic save, do not trust it 100% yet.

---

## Pen support

- At least Wacom styluses seem to work; but very limited testing has been done so far.
- HTML color picker's eyedropper does not work at all with pen touch - map click (left) to a button to get around this issue.
- Pressure sensitivity did not function in browser (Chrome) when Windows Ink was disabled in Wacom settings.
- The pen controls sometimes start to fail and you can't adjust widgets.

---

## Updates 1.0.1

- Refactored to more modular code structure for new features (coming later) and maintainability
- Added new custom modular confirmation modals
- Added new custom modular input elements
- Added Canvas offset tool with wraparound
- Added simple radius based blur tool
- Improved mouse event handling
- Improved canvas interaction states
- Improved button UX (hover/click states)
- IMproved input validation
- Improved widget size calculation (should reduce UI glitches)
- Improved dynamic node resize setup
